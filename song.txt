Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most
--------------------

[Chorus]
Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world
